Write a script that simulates a simple dice gambling game.
The game is played as follows: roll a six sided die.
If you roll a 1 or 2 the game is over.If you roll a 3, no money is earned and the you has the right to roll the dice again.
If you roll a 4, 5, or 6, you win that many dollars ($4, $5, or $6), and then roll again.
With each additional roll, you have the chance to win more money, or you might roll a game-ending 1 or  2at which time the game is over and you keep whatever winnings you have accumulated.
When your total winnings are $ 50, the game is ended by giving the message "You have earned the maximum amount of money you can earn".
